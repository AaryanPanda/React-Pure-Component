Question: Which out of the two components (which are performing the same functionality) is performing better and how?


Answer: The Pure Counter component performs better because it uses "shouldComponentUpdate" to avoid unnecessary renders when props or state haven't changed. This helps to improve performance by skipping updates when nothing has actually changed.
